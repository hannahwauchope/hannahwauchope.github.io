### How will climate change affect birds breeding in the Arctic?

We were interested to know what might happen to species that migrate to breed in the Arctic under coming climate change. Many bird species fly north to breed in the fertile and light filled Arctic summers and then return south to avoid the harsh Arctic winter. But as the Arctic warms there will be less and less space that is cool enough to fulfil the habitat requirements for Arctic species. How will this affect the birds that breed there, and could it affect the migratory routes they follow?

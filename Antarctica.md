### Antarctic Protected Areas

Antarctica is one of the Earth's last spans of intact wilderness, but protection of Antarctic biodiversity lags behind the rest of the world. Though Antarctica is generally designated as a place for [peace](https://www.ats.aq/e/ats_governance.htm) and [science](https://www.ats.aq/e/ats_science.htm), the biodiversity isn't automatically protected to the degree it might need. This is especially so on the mainland, where, despite the amount of ice, there is a lot of life. Ice free areas in dry valleys and on mountain tops (called Nunataks) hold communities of organisms, many of which have highly unique genomes. To ensure these species are protected, we first need to understand what the current state of protection is. We worked to answer some basic questions, such as which Antarctic species live within Antarctic Specially Protected Areas ([ASPAs](https://www.ats.aq/e/ep_protected.htm), the name for what are essential Antarctic nature reserves) and more importantly which species do *not* occur in any ASPAs. The full paper can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08915-6), and a summary of our findings is shown here:

### Restoring the Macquarie Island Red Crown Parakeet

The Southern Ocean encircles the Antarctic continent, and contains a number of small Sub-Antarctic Islands. These islands are hotspots of biodiversity, where many species of birds and seals flock to breed. Surpringsly, some of these islands are home to tropical looking parakeets!

These little birds, which constitute various species and subspecies of the Red-crowned parakeet (*Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae*) clade, live on a handful of islands in the New Zealand Sub-Antarctic, but one species of them used to exist on an Australian Sub-Antarctic islands, Macquarie Island.

In a classic example of blah blah, the introduction of rabbits to the island meant the cat population was able to expand, and eventually [hunt the parakeets to extinction](https://newzealandecology.org/nzje/1448.pdf).

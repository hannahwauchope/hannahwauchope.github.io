Often conservationists need to know when they can trust the population trend of a species. If you have 5 years of data that tells you your populations of Shoebills is declining, do you immediately start taking action assuming something is wrong? Or could this just be part of the natural ups and downs of the population? (For the record, this study had nothing to do with Shoebills in particular, I just think they're cool).

And equally, what if your vulnerable penguin population was increasing in number over three years - could you conclude they were starting to do better and reduce monitoring and conservation efforts? Or could this just be a bit of natural variation amongst an overall pattern of decline? 

This question doesn't only apply to single populations, but to large scale studies as well. For example, the Living Planet Index tracks population trends of thousands of species across the world, but can sometimes have populations with as little as three years of data. When summaries are made with trends from all sorts of varying time-lengths, is there a way to have an idea of how much more trustworthy a 3-year trend is from a 20-year trend?

I set up to try and answer this question. Using a dataset of tens of thousands of waterbird population trends, I wanted to know how likely it was that trends from varying lengths (of time) matched the longer term trends of the population.

This is a case of us getting entirely the wrong idea about a population trend from a data subset. If we had only surveyed the population in these 5 years we'd think it was doing brilliantly!
